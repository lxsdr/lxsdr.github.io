Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.

Jennifer Lawrence dazzled \u2014 and won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actress \u2014 as the tough and inspired neighborhood girl recovering from her own tragedies.  She synchronized with gem performances by fellow Academy Award nominees Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who created an emotional household unlike any other in film built upon this father's superstitious bookmaking on Philadelphia Eagles games.  With a stellar cast rounded out by Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Anupam Kehr, Shea Whigham, and Julia Stiles, the film was singled out by US Senators in Washington seeking parity for mental health treatment and services.
